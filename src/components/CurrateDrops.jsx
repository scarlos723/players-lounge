            We have a big focus on IRL experiences also, it could be a game of
            one-on-one with a particular player, a twitch gaming stream, stadium
            & training ground tours, attending major events or functions with your
            favourite player or even choosing which boots they wear in a game! We
            have some really fun and
            unique experiences we look forward to sharing with you all very soon!

            We’re going to have constant planned IRL events for the community.
            One of the perks of them traveling a lot is that sometimes it’ll be
            as simple as one of the player saying, “hey,
            I’m in…... Any Players Lounge holders want to have breakfast?”, etc.
